The author of the **Multi-topography Dataset for Wind Turbine Detection** have compiled the land remote sensing wind turbine dataset, comprising 1270 remote sensing images containing a total of 4459 individual wind turbines. These images were captured over an extensive time span, showing the same wind farm at different times. The dataset includes both YOLO and VOC tagging formats to accommodate different model requirements.

The dataset is categorized into five groups based on the land background: sandy land, forest land, grassland, snow land, and wasteland. Having diverse land backgrounds enhances the model's robustness, while the presence of various marker formats and a substantial number of wind turbine instances caters to the object detection needs of different models.

Due to variations in power wind turbine sizes, the multi-angle imaging characteristics of remote sensing satellites, as well as the varying solar radiation angles in different seasons and vegetation shading, wind turbines exhibit significant differences in the images. The image features of the wind turbine shadow are more distinct than those of the wind turbine body. In light of this, to improve the wind turbine detection model's accuracy, the authors opted to label the wind turbine body and its shadow together as a single unit while using the labelImg tool for target labeling.
