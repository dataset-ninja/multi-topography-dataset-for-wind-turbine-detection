**Multi-topography dataset for wind turbine detection from remote sensing image** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry.

The dataset consists of 1270 images with 4453 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*windTurbine*).

Images in the Wind Turbines 6 dataset has bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabled image (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *train* (1270 images). The dataset was released in 2023.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
