**Multi-topography Dataset for Wind Turbine Detection from Remote Sensing Image** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 1270 images with 4458 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*wind turbine*).

Images in the Multi-topography Dataset for Wind Turbine Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 13 locations: ***Baicheng*** (258 images), ***Tongliao*** (195 images), ***Tieling*** (134 images), ***Yilan*** (131 images), ***Ximeng*** (112 images), ***Ürümqi*** (93 images), ***Hami*** (92 images), ***Wulanchabu*** (75 images), ***Baqi*** (51 images), ***Chifeng*** (46 images), ***Jiamusi*** (45 images), ***Huiteng*** (33 images), and ***Mudanjiang*** (5 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the Shandong University of Science and Technology.
