**Multi-topography dataset for wind turbine detection from remote sensing image** is a dataset for object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 1270 images with 4453 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*windTurbine*).

Images in the Multi-topography dataset for wind turbine detection dataset have bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabeled image (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2023.
